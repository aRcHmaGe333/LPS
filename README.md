# Layered Publishing System (LPS)

Layered Publishing System is an invention exploring a multi-depth approach to structuring and consuming knowledge. This repository now serves as the living strategy hub for evolving the concept from vision to implementation.

## Repository Guide

- `layered_publishing_system.md` — the original manifesto describing the concept, psychology, and pilot roadmap.
- `docs/findings.md` — verbatim record of the initial assessment and opportunity analysis.
- `docs/concept_evolution.md` — audience journeys, authoring toolkit, and prototype guidelines.
- `docs/product_architecture.md` — technical blueprint, user roles, and analytics requirements.
- `docs/community_governance.md` — governance charter, incentives, and moderation playbook.
- `docs/business_strategy.md` — market positioning, pricing hypotheses, and partnership strategy.
- `docs/execution_roadmap.md` — phased plan with milestones, KPIs, and resource considerations.
- `docs/branding_communications.md` — narrative, visual identity, and go-to-market communication plan.

## Getting Involved

Layered Publishing System remains an All Rights Reserved initiative, but the repository is intentionally public so anyone can read the materials, share feedback, and follow the project’s evolution. Editing rights, branching, and direct contributions stay limited to invited team members operating under a formal collaboration agreement.

### Access Model

- **Public readability stays on.** Repository visibility is set to Public so readers can browse the codebase, star it, watch for updates, and open issues or discussions to share observations.
- **Write permissions stay invite-only.** Branch protection rules and required reviews ensure that only approved maintainers can push changes or merge pull requests.
- **Forks are optional sandboxes.** Allowing forks lets interested readers explore ideas or draft feedback in their own copies without touching the canonical repo. Because the project is All Rights Reserved, those forks cannot redistribute the material commercially, and maintainers still decline unsolicited pull requests. If a period arises where even sandboxed copies feel risky, the team can disable “Allow forking” temporarily in repository settings.

If you are an investor, partner, or prospective teammate who would like to discuss participation, please open an issue outlining your interest or reach out through existing channels so the core team can coordinate next steps.

### Access & Forking FAQ

- **Why don’t I see an “Approve changes” button?** Only collaborators with the required GitHub role (typically `Write` or above) and branch protection privileges can review and approve pull requests. Public readers can comment on issues or discussions instead.
- **Do maintainers need to approve every change?** Yes. Branch protection rules keep merges blocked until a designated maintainer signs off, ensuring the canonical history stays curated.
- **What happens to existing forks if “Allow forking” is disabled?** Disabling the setting prevents *new* forks from being created. Any forks that already exist stay visible to their owners; they simply stop receiving upstream updates unless the owner rebases manually. Re-enabling the option later allows new forks again.
- **I’m the owner—where do I approve changes?** Open the pull request in GitHub’s web UI, click the **Files changed** tab, and use the **Review changes** button in the top-right corner to leave comments or select **Approve**. If branch protection requires reviewers to be requested explicitly, add yourself via **Reviewers** first. Repository admins can also adjust branch protection to allow self-approval or direct merges when appropriate.
- **Why do I only see “Create draft PR / Copy git apply / Copy patch”?** Those controls appear when you’re viewing the comparison page before a pull request exists. They simply let you open a new PR or copy the diff for manual application. To approve an existing PR, open it directly (e.g., from the **Pull requests** tab), then follow the **Files changed → Review changes** workflow described above.
- **What if I’m ready to approve changes from the comparison view?** Click **Create pull request** (or **Create draft PR** if you want to stage it first). Once the PR is created, switch to the **Files changed** tab and use **Review changes → Approve**. Creating the PR doesn’t merge anything automatically—it just opens the review surface so maintainers can provide feedback or approval before merging.
