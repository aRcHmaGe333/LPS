# Layered Publishing System (LPS)

Layered Publishing System is an invention exploring a multi-depth approach to structuring and consuming knowledge. This repository is the public-facing strategy library that shares the narrative, conceptual scaffolding, and curated plans required to appreciate the vision at a glance.

## Purpose of This Repository
- **Show the vision.** Provide investors, partners, and curious readers with a clear, high-level understanding of how Layered Publishing works and why it matters.
- **Signal momentum.** Demonstrate that strategic, product, and governance thinking is underway without revealing confidential execution details.
- **Invite dialogue.** Encourage thoughtful feedback through issues or discussions while keeping authorship and roadmap control with the core team.

## Public Library
- `layered_publishing_system.md` — the foundational manifesto describing the concept, psychology, and early pilot ideas.
- `docs/findings.md` — verbatim snapshot of the initial assessment that inspired the structured follow-up.
- `docs/concept_evolution.md` — experience journeys, authoring guidelines, and prototype suggestions at a conceptual level.
- `docs/product_architecture.md` — technical principles, capability map, and integration considerations meant for open review.
- `docs/community_governance.md` — public charter outlining values and contributor expectations while deferring sensitive controls to private operations playbooks.
- `docs/business_strategy.md` — external-facing market thesis, positioning pillars, and partnership themes (financial specifics are held privately).
- `docs/execution_roadmap.md` — phase outlines and learning objectives without confidential KPIs or hiring targets.
- `docs/branding_communications.md` — messaging anchors and storytelling cues for future campaigns.

## Stewardship Principles
- **All Rights Reserved.** The work is published for reading and discussion; reuse requires explicit permission from the owner.
- **Curated updates.** Only invited maintainers can commit changes. External suggestions are gathered through issues, discussions, or direct outreach.
- **Selective transparency.** Detailed financials, proprietary metrics, and contractual terms live in private systems. Public files highlight direction while protecting execution advantage.
- **Feedback welcome.** If you spot opportunities or wish to collaborate, open an issue summarizing your perspective and a maintainer will follow up.

## How Decisions Are Managed
The maintainer periodically reviews repository content to ensure every public document serves the project’s best interest. Materials that should remain confidential are summarized at a high level and stored in private knowledge bases. If circumstances change—such as new partners, updated policies, or sensitive discoveries—the relevant public files will be refreshed accordingly.
