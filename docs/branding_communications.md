# Branding & Communication Plan

## Narrative Architecture
- **Positioning Statement**: "Layered Publishing turns knowledge into an adventure, revealing the strategy, debates, and evidence behind every idea—one satisfying peel at a time."
- **Key Messages**:
  1. *Adaptive Depth*: Readers control how deep they go.
  2. *Transparent Thinking*: Every layer exposes real decision-making.
  3. *Collective Intelligence*: Communities co-create validated insights.
  4. *Trusted Quality*: Quality gates ensure every layer delivers genuine value.
- **Story Framework (ACT)**:
  - **Acknowledge** the frustration of flat, one-size-fits-all content.
  - **Catalyze** curiosity with the peel appeal metaphor and interactive experiences.
  - **Transform** by inviting audiences into a shared exploration of layered knowledge.

## Visual Identity System
- **Logo & Motif**: Animated page-corner fold symbolizing hidden depth; variations for static print, motion, and iconography.
- **Color Palette**:
  - *Curiosity Teal* (#1DB6C7) — invitation to explore.
  - *Insight Indigo* (#312783) — depth and expertise.
  - *Signal Gold* (#F5A623) — premium or newly unlocked layers.
  - *Trust Slate* (#2F3C4E) — grounding neutral for text-heavy views.
- **Typography**:
  - Headings: Geometric sans-serif (e.g., Avenir Next) for modern clarity.
  - Body: Humanist serif (e.g., Source Serif Pro) for long-form readability.
  - Monospace accent for code/technical layers.
- **Motion Guidelines**:
  - Peel animation duration: 400ms ease-in-out.
  - Flutter state triggered when high-value layer available.
  - Golden glow loop no more than 1.5s to avoid distraction.
