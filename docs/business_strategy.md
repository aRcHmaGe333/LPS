This document shares the outward-facing business narrative for the Layered Publishing System. Detailed financial models, pricing experiments, and partner term sheets are maintained in private workspaces so the project preserves its competitive advantage.

## Positioning Highlights

- **Cross-sector utility.** Strategy teams, academic programs, consultancies, and public institutions each gain tailored value from the same layered content architecture.

## Market Themes
1. **Strategy & Innovation Leaders** seek tools that reveal how insights were formed, enabling aligned execution and stakeholder buy-in.
2. **Higher Education Networks** need engaging, inquiry-driven curricula that adapt to diverse learner depths.
