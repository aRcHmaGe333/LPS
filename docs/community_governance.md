# Community & Governance Framework (Public Charter)

The public charter shares the values, structures, and participation pathways for the Layered Publishing System. Implementation specifics—such as contract language, access control configurations, and compliance records—are stored in private governance repositories.

## Governance Charter
- **Mission:** Safeguard the integrity, inclusivity, and long-term sustainability of Layered Publishing ecosystems.
- **Principles:**
  1. *Transparency:* Key decisions and rationales are documented for stakeholders.
  2. *Reciprocity:* Contributors earn privileges and rewards proportionate to the value they create.
  3. *Informed Diversity:* Multidisciplinary perspectives are welcomed while upholding evidence-based standards.
  4. *Adaptive Oversight:* Policies evolve with community feedback and empirical results.
- **Structure:**
  - Governance Council providing policy stewardship and dispute oversight.
  - Advisory Board representing focus verticals (business, education, civic) convened quarterly.
  - Ombudsperson role championing user rights and managing transparency reports.

## Policy Stack (Public Summary)
1. **Content Standards:** Define sourcing expectations, attribution norms, and layered disclosure requirements for sensitive topics.
2. **Ethical Guidelines:** Address conflicts of interest, AI usage transparency, and handling of proprietary materials.
3. **Contribution Agreement:** Affirms the All Rights Reserved stance, clarifies IP ownership, and explains that editing privileges are extended only to invited collaborators operating under signed agreements. Public readers can follow progress and share feedback without direct commit access.
4. **Data Stewardship Policy:** Outlines retention, privacy, and anonymization expectations for reader analytics and community insights.

## Contributor Incentive Concepts
- Reputation signals that reflect accepted contributions, mentorship, and reviewer excellence.
- Achievement badges highlighting milestones (e.g., first multi-layer contribution, consistently high insight scores).
- Revenue-sharing pools or stipends for premium content contributors, calibrated with impact metrics.
- Future exploration of non-transferable tokens representing governance participation, contingent on legal and ethical review.

## Moderation Playbook (High Level)
1. **Intake:** Automated and human checks ensure submissions meet baseline quality.
2. **Reviewer Assignment:** Balanced routing considers expertise, workload, and conflicts of interest.
3. **Evaluation:** Reviewers provide rubric scores and actionable feedback; disagreements trigger secondary review.
4. **Dispute Resolution:** Time-boxed mediation with documented outcomes and improvement paths.
5. **Escalation:** Serious violations escalate to the Governance Council and, if necessary, result in access suspension.

## Community Programs
- **Onboarding Labs:** Workshops that teach taxonomy, tooling, and quality gates.
- **Mentorship Circles:** Pairing emerging contributors with experienced reviewers.
- **Transparency Reports:** Periodic publications summarizing acceptance rates, disputes, and diversity metrics.
- **Feedback Forum:** Moderated spaces for policy proposals, AMAs, and community spotlights.

## Metrics & Monitoring
The public dashboard highlights dispute frequency, turnaround time, contributor retention, diversity indicators, and satisfaction scores. Detailed reviewer analytics and compliance logs are maintained privately.

## Implementation Notes
- Foundational policies are ratified early, with continuous iteration informed by pilot cohorts.
- Private governance workspaces manage branch protection rules, CODEOWNERS assignments, and access audits.
- Standing automation instructions (for example, assistant-led documentation) are documented internally and reviewed regularly to ensure they continue to serve the project’s interests.
