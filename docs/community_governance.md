# Community & Governance Framework

## Governance Charter
- **Mission**: Safeguard the integrity, inclusivity, and long-term sustainability of Layered Publishing content ecosystems.
- **Principles**:
  1. *Transparency*: Every gate decision and dispute outcome is documented and accessible to relevant stakeholders.
  2. *Reciprocity*: Contributors earn privileges and rewards proportionate to the value they create.
  3. *Informed Diversity*: Encourage multidisciplinary perspectives while upholding evidence-based standards.
  4. *Adaptive Oversight*: Policies evolve with community feedback and empirical results.
- **Structure**:
  - Governance Council (5–7 elected members) overseeing policy updates and escalated disputes.
  - Advisory Board representing key verticals (business, education, public sector) meeting quarterly.
  - Ombudsperson role to champion user rights and manage transparency reports.

## Policy Stack
1. **Content Standards**: Defines acceptable sourcing, attribution, and evidence quality; mandates citation layering for sensitive topics.
2. **Ethical Guidelines**: Covers conflicts of interest, AI usage disclosure, and handling of proprietary information.
 3. **Contribution Agreement**: Clarifies IP ownership (dual licensing for public vs. premium layers), affirms the project's All Rights Reserved status, and restricts editing/publishing permissions to invited collaborators operating under executed agreements. Public read access and discussion channels remain open so interested observers can review and comment without gaining write privileges. External parties engage through structured proposals and review cycles prior to receiving any elevated repository access.
4. **Data Stewardship Policy**: Dictates retention, anonymization, and reader privacy expectations.

## Contributor Incentive Model
- **Reputation Points**: Earned for accepted layers, positive reader ratings, and mentorship contributions; decays over time to encourage ongoing participation.
- **Badges & Titles**:
  - *Peel Pioneer*: First-time layer accepted beyond Level 2.
  - *Insight Alchemist*: Maintains average insight score ≥ 18 across 10+ layers.
  - *Guardian of Gates*: Reviewer with 95% SLA compliance and low dispute reversal rate.
- **Revenue Sharing**:
  - 20% of premium subscription revenue allocated to a creator pool.
  - Distribution based on weighted combination of layer engagement, quality score, and retention impact.
- **Tokenized Rewards (Future Phase)**:
  - Non-transferable soulbound tokens representing governance voting power.
  - Milestone NFTs for landmark contributions, unlocking event invitations or co-marketing opportunities.

## Moderation Playbook
1. **Intake**: Automated filters flag submissions lacking citations or containing restricted content. Authors receive instant feedback.
2. **Reviewer Assignment**: Balanced roster algorithm considers expertise tags, workload, and potential conflicts of interest.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Reviewers provide rubric scores and qualitative notes.
   - Disputed scores trigger secondary review by Governance Council liaisons.
4. **Dispute Resolution**:
   - Time-boxed mediation (72 hours) with structured dialogue.
   - Final ruling documented with rationale and improvement guidance.
5. **Escalation**:
   - Serious violations (misinformation, ethical breaches) escalate to Ombudsperson for investigation and potential suspension.

## Community Programs
- **Onboarding Labs**: Monthly workshops teaching taxonomy, tooling, and quality gates with live feedback sessions.
- **Mentorship Circles**: Pair emerging contributors with experienced reviewers to accelerate ramp-up.
- **Transparency Reports**: Quarterly publication detailing acceptance rates, dispute statistics, and diversity metrics.
- **Feedback Forum**: Open channel (Discourse/Discord) with moderated AMAs and policy proposal templates.

## Metrics & Monitoring
- Dispute frequency per 100 submissions.
- Average time from submission to decision.
- Contributor retention segmented by persona.
- Diversity index of published perspectives.
- Governance satisfaction survey scores.

## Implementation Timeline
- **Month 0–1**: Ratify charter, recruit interim council, publish baseline policies.
- **Month 2–3**: Launch reputation system MVP, onboard first reviewer cohort, pilot transparency dashboard.
- **Month 4–6**: Introduce revenue-sharing beta, host mentorship circles, iterate on dispute tooling.
- **Month 6+**: Evaluate tokenized rewards, expand advisory board, conduct annual policy summit.

## Access Control Guidance
- Maintain GitHub visibility as **Public** to support transparency and community feedback.
- Enable **branch protection** and require pull-request reviews from the Governance Council before merges.
- Limit the **Write** team to vetted collaborators under signed agreements; all others interact through issues, discussions, or curated feedback forms.
- Review the **Allow forking** setting quarterly; when enabled it signals openness to experimentation while keeping the canonical repo protected. Forks operate as personal sandboxes—maintainers still decline unsolicited pull requests and the All Rights Reserved status prohibits unauthorized redistribution. Disable the setting temporarily if leakage risk outweighs the discovery value; existing forks remain intact but no new forks can be created while the toggle is off.
- Document reviewer permissions so collaborators know who can formally approve pull requests; public observers will not see approval controls, preserving curator oversight.
- Provide owners with a quick-reference: approvals live under the **Files changed → Review changes** workflow in GitHub’s web UI, and administrators can add themselves as reviewers or adjust branch protection rules if they need to self-approve a change.
- Note that the **Create draft PR / Copy git apply / Copy patch** buttons belong to the comparison view before a pull request exists; they are for opening a PR or exporting the diff, not for approvals. When ready to review, click **Create pull request** to open the PR (draft or regular), then move to **Files changed → Review changes** to approve. Creating the PR doesn’t merge automatically—it simply surfaces the review controls for designated maintainers.
- Use **CODEOWNERS** (future enhancement) to route review responsibility to the appropriate domain leads.
- Document any standing instructions that grant the assistant autonomy (e.g., “document findings and execute the plan”) so maintainers remember why proactive commits appear. Update or revoke those instructions when you prefer discussion-only feedback; the assistant will stop generating new commits once the directive changes.
