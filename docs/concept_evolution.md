# Concept & Content Evolution Strategy

## Persona-Driven Journeys

### Corporate Strategy Team (Enterprise SaaS)
1. **Trigger**: Quarterly planning session requires synthesizing market intelligence and execution updates.
2. **Layer Path**:
   - *Layer 1*: Executive brief summarizing OKRs, key wins, and next-quarter bets.
   - *Layer 2*: Internal debates on prioritizing AI feature rollouts vs. vertical expansion, annotated with stakeholder quotes.
   - *Layer 3*: Risk ledger outlining regulatory uncertainty, talent bottlenecks, and mitigation tactics.
   - *Layer 4*: Systems map connecting macroeconomic indicators, competitor positioning, and partner ecosystems.
   - *Layer 5*: Rolling performance dashboard with experiment results, customer feedback loops, and board commentary.
3. **Success Metrics**: Decision-cycle time reduced by 30%, executive alignment score above 8/10, measurable increase in cross-functional adoption of strategic narratives.

### University Faculty (Interdisciplinary Course)
1. **Trigger**: Designing a cross-listed curriculum that balances foundational theory with applied case studies.
2. **Layer Path**:
   - *Layer 1*: Student-facing module overview with weekly objectives.
   - *Layer 2*: Instructor rationale for sequencing, including research controversies.
   - *Layer 3*: Supplementary readings with annotated debates, assignment alternatives, and rubrics.
   - *Layer 4*: Connections to adjacent departments, industry partnerships, and grant opportunities.
   - *Layer 5*: Student submissions curated for future cohorts, plus longitudinal learning analytics.
3. **Success Metrics**: +20% student engagement on optional materials, improved assessment performance, faculty collaboration index across departments.

### Policy Analyst (Civic Innovation Lab)
1. **Trigger**: Evaluating a smart-city proposal with community stakeholders and regulatory agencies.
2. **Layer Path**:
   - *Layer 1*: Public-friendly summary of policy intent and expected outcomes.
   - *Layer 2*: Stakeholder negotiation notes, scenario modeling assumptions, and dissenting opinions.
   - *Layer 3*: Implementation risk register, compliance checklists, and funding contingencies.
   - *Layer 4*: Comparative analysis of similar initiatives globally, with socio-economic ripple effects.
   - *Layer 5*: Post-deployment metrics, citizen feedback, and iterative policy adjustments.
3. **Success Metrics**: Higher civic participation rates, reduced approval-cycle friction, transparent audit trail satisfying watchdog groups.

## Layer Taxonomy Toolkit

| Layer | Purpose | Gate Criteria | Author Prompts |
|-------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | Anchor narrative & immediate value | Clear thesis, standalone clarity | "What must every reader grasp before they leave?" |
| 2 | Reveal strategic thinking | Demonstrated reasoning, decision evidence | "Which trade-offs did we wrestle with?" |
| 3 | Surface complexity | Edge cases, unresolved questions | "Where could this fail or vary?" |
| 4 | Connect systems | Interdependencies, foresight | "How does this reshape adjacent domains?" |
| 5+ | Continuously evolve | Validated updates, community insights | "What did we learn after shipping or engaging the community?" |

### Authoring Checklist
- Define the *reader persona* and their cognitive starting point.
- Articulate the *insight delta* each layer must deliver beyond the previous one.
- Identify *primary evidence* (data, quotes, diagrams) supporting the layer’s claims.
- Tag potential *cross-layer callbacks* to encourage non-linear exploration.
- Pre-select *validation reviewers* for layers 3 and above.

### Insight Threshold Rubric
- **Novelty Score (0–5)**: Introduces fresh information or synthesis.
- **Actionability (0–5)**: Enables a decision, behavior, or design change.
- **Evidence Integrity (0–5)**: Supported by credible data or expert consensus.
- **Engagement Hook (0–5)**: Presents compelling narrative, visual, or interactive element.
- Minimum total score to publish a layer: **15/20** with no category below 3.

## Case Study Prototypes

### Prototype A: Interactive Notion Playbook
- Structure layered pages using toggle blocks and database views.
- Embed callouts indicating quality gates and reviewer approvals.
- Capture usage analytics via Notion API exports to validate layer engagement depth.

### Prototype B: Static Site (Eleventy or Astro)
- Implement multi-layer navigation using progressive disclosure components.
- Use color-coded corner badges to emulate the animated page-corner brand motif.
- Deploy Netlify analytics and simple feedback forms to test reader appetite.

### Prototype C: Figma Click-Through
- Showcase the “peel” animation and gamified layer badges.
- Include flow for author submissions and reviewer approvals.
- Facilitate stakeholder review sessions to stress-test usability before engineering begins.

### Prototype Validation Loop
1. Recruit 5–7 target users per persona and present relevant prototype.
2. Observe navigation patterns, comprehension, and perceived value per layer.
3. Collect qualitative quotes, time-on-layer metrics, and willingness-to-pay signals.
4. Iterate taxonomy and design components based on findings.

## Next Steps
- Publish the toolkit as a downloadable PDF and Miro board for collaborative workshops.
- Build a repository of exemplar layered documents to accelerate onboarding of new contributors.
- Integrate feedback capture mechanisms into every prototype to feed the insight scoring engine requirements.
